# vulkan-study
A basic project to understand and implement the vulkan API to make a basic graphics engine.

# Development currently on pause
Until vulkan has better documentation on their shader engine, i wont be able to do much with this project. I will see about making the shaders work with the given GLSL translator but GLSL seems to act differently with vulkan as well, making the correct documentation harder to find.
