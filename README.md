# vulkan-study
A basic project to understand and implement the vulkan API to make a basic graphics engine.

~~# Development currently on pause
Until vulkan has better documentation on their shader engine, i wont be able to do much with this project. I will see about making the shaders work with the given GLSL translator but GLSL seems to act differently with vulkan as well, making the correct documentation harder to find.

Jk lol, figured it out after a couple hours. the shader name is hardcoded though so if you want something else displayed you are limited to vertex and fragment shaders and they need to be put in a 'shaders' directory within 'build'
